As a researcher in the field of computer graphics and computational photography, I have a passion for exploring new ways to represent and analyze visual data. My research interests include image processing, compressed sensing for visual data, machine learning, and synthetic data generation. My expertise are in visual machine learning algorithm, high dynamic range imaging, photo-realistic rendering, compressive imaging, and light fields.


I am deeply interested by the potential of fair representation learning for enhancing machine learning algorithms and AI systems. My aim is to create models that promote inclusivity and ethical decision-making in AI technologies.

I completed my Postdoc in Computer Graphics and Image Processing Group between 2020-2022, received my PhD from Linköping University in 2020, with a focus on High Dynamic Range Imaging and Light Fields, under the supervision of <a href="https://itn-web.it.liu.se/~jonun48/web/Home.php" target="_blank">Prof. Jonas Unger</a>. I received my Master's degree in Computer Graphics from Linköping University in 2013, and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Amirkabir University in Tehran.
I am always excited to learn and apply new techniques to better understand and improve the way we interact with visual data.
